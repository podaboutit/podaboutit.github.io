        <p>
            Whenever I set out to do anything, I set out first to uncover the rules of the game. Why would someone play a game without first knowing the rules? To understand the rules of the game is to learn how to win. Can you win a game while breaking the rules? In my mind, you cannot. It is not a true victory. You may receive all the trappings that come with victory but you will not receive victory. Victory can only be given by your mind to your heart. Victory is the knowledge that you achieved the outcome that everyone else was attempting to achieve by way of the rules set before each contestant.

            What intelligence does it take to see a rule and say, "I will not follow this rule." Very little. It takes intellect to deconstruct a rule down to its parts. It takes savvy to find the places it can bear argumentative freight.  What about bending the rules? Interpreting the rules? Now here is where true genius lies. I operate in the bend but curves are hard to see if you’re used to looking at horizons all day.

            So, no, maybe I don't "break the conventions of the genre." If the charge is taking care of the genre that I love and that has loved me, then I am guilty. I've pushed the boundaries far enough to fit my work and my voice. To break those same boundaries would be to release that voice out into a meaningless, shapeless, unforgiving universe. Why would I do that? There must be a discourse to add to. There must be a genre to reinvent. This reviewer would have me burn down the house in order to sell it. Easy to say when you are selling matches.
