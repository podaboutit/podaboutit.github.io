        <p>
            "Leonard Lee forgot his cigarettes at home and the world changed forever. That's how fragile this world is."
            <br/>                  
            --Leonard Lee, tape recording, October 1979  
            <br/>
            Time slows down when I'm feeling anxious. I remember walking into the sheriff's office for the first time and thinking I stepped inside a living Renaissance painting. All of these uniformed men in various poses. Some were pointing at pictures splayed on a table. Others were hunched over notepads furiously scribbling. One man was screaming into a phone receiver. A rather large man delivering a Coca Cola. All of them surrounding a single individual. His stark white button down almost blinding amongst all the Texas State Trooper taupe.   

            Time stood still when he looked at me for the first time. He smiled slowly to reveal a gold tooth. Gold plated, underneath a rotting nothing.  Like the Coca Cola ushered in, the cigarette in between his stained fingers and a copy of Playboy peeking out from under the stacks of pictures in front of him...I was another one of his "requests."  
            <br/>
            "'Request' is a word people say when they demand something but know that the person they're talking to cannot abide by the word 'demand'" Leonard would go on to tell me later. He would tell me a lot.   There are a lot of moments in life we simply happen into that we never prepared for. Nothing can prepare you for your first child, divorce, an injury, a major accident, a death in the family. Meeting Leonard was all of those things wrapped up into one. When I was with him I was simply reacting on the fly. Attempting to decode and compartmentalize what I was seeing, hearing and feeling. Trying desperately to remember every detail. But something deep inside me, always pulling, tried to let me know that none of this mattered. It wasn't right. It wasn't real. Everybody had implicitly signed off on the game we were playing. Everybody would go on to explicitly deny that the game every existed. That's how these particular games work. It's a highly classified game of tag. When I walked into my brother's station that day I was "it." Unfortunately no one let me know until it was too late.

            "I'm just going with the flow Tom. You ever heard that expression? Go with the flow? It's a nice expression. There's a rhythm to it."
