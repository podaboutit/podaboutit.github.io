            A continuing undated dialogue with myself and others. 

            There are a lot of negotiations happening despite the fact that most boardrooms lay empty. We’re negotiating how concerned we should be. We’re negotiating what precautions we should take. We’re negotiating who is really telling us the truth. We’re negotiating how privileged we’ve been all along, how racist we’ve been all along. We’re negotiating what to do in the face of systemic oppression and racism. We’re negotiating when to stand up and when to kneel, when to speak out and when to stay silent. Does my mask need to cover my entire chin and do I need to wear it outside? There are too many regulations. There are not enough regulations. That statue must come down, this mural must remain. How unoccupied can a zone truly be?  

            In the face of all of these negotiations it’s easy to drown in sorrow and despair. “Where are the answers? Give it to me straight Doc!” I yell into the abyss.   

            With what appears to be a complete abdication of moral and political authority, many are faced with a terrifying reality: it’s up to individuals to decide their fate. That reality has always existed but the extent to which it is hidden varies. And it’s terrifying enough to think that no one person can give you a definitive answer on what to do and how to think and how to stay safe and how to deny your privilege and fight racism. What really makes the bed covers sweat is the idea that everyone else in the entire world, all 7 billion of us, are operating under the same negotiations and confusion.   

            What will authority mean post-pandemic? Idols were already under assault well before people were giving basic physics lessons on Youtube to bring down bronze. Sports figures caught cheating, Presidents caught lying, whole denominations committing and covering up living-death. Even the veneer of the almighty dollar started to give way to a generation that began to wonder if meaning meant American dreaming.   

            When all of the statues come down, metal and metaphorical, what will we put in there place? 

            Is anything worthy of worship?
