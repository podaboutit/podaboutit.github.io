        <p>
            A warm summer night and sips of whiskey
            <br/>
            I feel this moment like a mystery
            <br/>
            It hurts to know she isn't here
            <br/>
            growing old, changing, bending an ear
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A sibilant song from an insect chorus
            <br/>
            I know their repetitions aren't for me
            <br/>
            Just like mine aren't for them 
            <br/>
            But then...who are they for?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A still air surrounds yellow lamplight
            <br/>
            It isn't quiet but cars pass slower
            <br/>
            I well up a little when I imagine
            <br/>
            the things she would say. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But I was of her repetitions
            <br/>
            they werenâ€™t for me.
