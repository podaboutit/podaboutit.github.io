        <h1>I remember sneaking away from Captain Planet</h1>
        <p>
            I remember sneaking away,
			            <br/>
            from Captain Planet and his friends,
                        <br/>
            hiding myself inside the ocean,
                        <br/>
            of a big blue Oldsmobile.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
            Curled up into cold,
                        <br/>
            floorboards, “quiet and still,”
                        <br/>
            waiting for her to ignite,
                        <br/>
            the loud engine of my delivery.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
            I tarry long to the threshold
                        <br/>
            the point where turning back
                        <br/>
            won’t make sense anymore. 
                        <br/>
            “quiet and still.”
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
            But I can’t see that point. 
                        <br/>
            I only hear the dull roar of the road.
                        <br/>
            I only memorize each bruise and gash.
                        <br/>
            I trust I’ll know it when I feel it.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
            In my strange boyhood logic, 
                        <br/>
            if I wait long enough, “quiet and still”
                        <br/>
            the world I wish for will be mine
                        <br/>
            all thanks to my cunning.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
            I never stopped to wonder
                        <br/>
            why the doors were never locked.
                        <br/>
            “Quiet and still. Quiet and still.”
                        <br/>
            until the big reveal.
                        <br/>
