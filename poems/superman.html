        <p>
            Internet said Superman was dead
            <br><br/>
            but maybe he’s on a break
            <br><br/>
            or packed up and went home.
            <br><br/>
            Now it’s just us.
            <br><br/>
            <br><br/>
            I remember his cape
            <br><br/>
            every way that it moved
            <br><br/>
            when he passed by us passersby
            <br><br/>
            faster than we could think.
            <br><br/>
            <br><br/>
            Maybe this will be the last day.
            <br><br/>
            Maybe this is what we’re left with,
            <br><br/>
            his villains and our hands.
            <br><br/>
            Superman died today.
